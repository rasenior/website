Nature is something that we should all explore, learn and benefit from – not as a luxury, but as a necessity.\nMy research is centred around understanding the drivers of biodiversity loss and the ways in which we can mitigate that loss. I have a keen interest in using advances in technology and open data to improve monitoring and inform evidence-based conservation. In particular, I believe that our understanding of climate and land-use change impacts is vastly improved by considering the climate that organims actually experience, the microclimate.\nOutside of the office, you’ll usually find me outside! I was made in the Happy Valley (a.k.a. the Calder Valley), which means I love fell running and dock pudding (minus the bacon), and I have a border collie x whippet called Moss.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a conservation biologist trying to find pragmatic solutions to the global biodiversity crisis.
