I am a **conservation biologist** trying to find pragmatic solutions to the global biodiversity crisis. Nature is something that we should all explore, learn and benefit from -- not as a luxury, but as a necessity.

My research is centred around understanding the drivers of biodiversity loss and the ways in which we can mitigate that loss. I have a keen interest in using advances in **technology and open data** to improve monitoring and inform evidence-based conservation. In particular, I believe that our understanding of climate and land-use change impacts is vastly improved by considering the climate that organims actually experience, the **microclimate**.

Outside of the office, you'll usually find me outside! I was made in the Happy Valley (a.k.a. the Calder Valley), which means I love fell running and dock pudding (minus the bacon), and I have a border collie x whippet called Moss.
